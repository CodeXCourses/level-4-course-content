# Assignment: Capstone Project - Coffee Shop Frontend

## Objective

Develop a professional frontend for a coffee shop using Next.js, which interfaces with an existing Express API that utilizes MongoDB. This website should function like a real e-commerce platform, showcasing your ability to create a user-friendly, visually appealing, and fully functional website.

## Instructions

### Website Requirements

1. **Product Display**: Implement a product display page that fetches product data from the MongoDB database via the Express API.
2. **Shopping Cart**: Include a shopping cart where users can add, modify, or remove products.
3. **Checkout System**: Implement a checkout system that simulates transaction processes.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is responsive and provides a seamless experience on all devices.
5. **Styling**: Use a CSS framework or custom CSS/Sass for styling. Aim for a clean, professional look that reflects a modern e-commerce site.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy your frontend on Vercel and ensure it integrates seamlessly with your backend API.

### Development Setup

- Clone the backend project (provided in previous lectures) and ensure it is running correctly.
- Set up a new Next.js project for the frontend and plan the structure of your coffee shop website.
- Implement the frontend features by connecting with the backend API, ensuring all functionalities are properly integrated and tested.
- Deploy your frontend application to Vercel, following best practices for deployment.

## Submission

- Submit the URL of your deployed frontend along with the GitHub repository link for both frontend and backend.
- Include a `README.md` in your frontend repository detailing the functionality implemented, technologies used, and any significant challenges you overcame during development.
