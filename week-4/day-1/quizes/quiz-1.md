  Incorrect: AWS Regions are a cluster of data centers, and are geographical constructs composed of two or more Availability Zones.

## Question 4:

Which of the following is NOT one of the Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing?

- A) Rapid elasticity and scalability
  Incorrect: This is one of the Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing. You quickly acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them. You also scale quickly based on demand.

- B) Multi-tenancy and resource pooling
  Incorrect: This is one of the Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing. Cloud Computing supports a multi-tenant model, and multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources.

- C) Dedicated Support Agent to help you deploy applications
  Correct: This is not one of the Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing. In the cloud, everything is self-service.

- D) On-demand self service
  Incorrect: This is one of the Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing. You can provision and use Cloud Computing resources without the need of human interaction from the service provider.

## Question 5:

Which are the 3 pricing fundamentals of the AWS Cloud?

- A) Compute, Storage, and Data transfer in the AWS Cloud
  Incorrect: Data transfer in the AWS Cloud is free.

- B) Compute, Networking, and Data transfer out of the AWS Cloud
  Incorrect: Networking is not a pricing fundamental of the AWS Cloud.

- C) Compute, Storage, and Data transfer out of the AWS Cloud
  Correct: Compute, Storage, and data transfer out of the AWS Cloud are the 3 pricing fundamentals of the AWS Cloud.

- D) Storage, Functions, and Data transfer in the AWS Cloud
  Incorrect: Storage, Functions and data transfer in the AWS Cloud are not pricing fundamentals of the AWS Cloud.

## Question 6:

Which of the following options is NOT a point of consideration when choosing an AWS Region?

- A) Compliance with data governance
  Incorrect: Compliance with data governance and legal requirements should be considered when choosing an AWS Region. You might have location-specific data regulations.

- B) Latency
  Incorrect: Proximity to customers (and therefore reduced latency) should be considered when choosing an AWS Region. You want to be as close as possible to your end users.

- C) Capacity availability
  Correct: Capacity is unlimited in the cloud, you do not need to worry about it. The 4 points of considerations when choosing an AWS Region are: compliance with data governance and legal requirements, proximity to customers, available services and features within a Region, and pricing.

- D) Pricing
  Incorrect: Pricing should be considered when choosing an AWS Region. It is transparent and varies from region to region. You might consider deploying your application in a Region with lower pricing.

## Question 7:

Which of the following is NOT an advantage of Cloud Computing?

  Incorrect: This is an advantage of Cloud Computing. With Cloud Computing you pay on-demand and benefit from reduced Total Cost of Ownership and Operational Expense (OPEX).

- B) Train your employees less
  Correct: You must train your employees more so they can use the cloud effectively.

- C) Go global in minutes
  Incorrect: This is an advantage of Cloud Computing.

- D) Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
  Incorrect: This is an advantage of Cloud Computing.

## Question 8:

AWS Regions are composed of?

- A) Two or more Edge Locations
  Incorrect: Edge Locations are used to distribute content closer to users.

- B) One or more discrete data centers
  Incorrect: Availability Zones are composed of one or more discrete data centers.

- C) Three or more Availability Zones
  Correct: AWS Regions consist of multiple, isolated, and physically separate Availability Zones within a geographic area.

## Question 9:

- B) Automatic and quick ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them
  Incorrect: This is the definition of Elasticity, not Cloud Computing.

- C) On-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user
  Correct: This is the definition of Cloud Computing.

- D) Change resource types when needed
  Incorrect: This is the definition of Flexibility, not Cloud Computing.
