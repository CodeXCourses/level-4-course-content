**NOTE:** async/await is a newer way to handle asynchronous code in JavaScript. It is built on top of promises. You can use await with any function that returns a promise. Both serve similar purposes. Some say async/await is more readable and easier to understand. But tutorials and code examples may use either method. It's good to be familiar with both.

1. How is asynchronous code like ordering coffee at a restaurant?
2. Compare the `.then()` method to the `await` keyword.
3. When using async/await, what is the purpose of the `await` keyword?
4. To handle errors in an async function, would we use `try/catch` or `.then()` and `.catch()`?
5. To handle errors after promise, would we use `try/catch` or `.then()` and `.catch()`?
